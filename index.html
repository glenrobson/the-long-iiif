        <i>In the following discussion, card indexes stand in for the computerised management systems that libraries, archives and museums really use!</i></p>
      
      <p>The cards in the library catalogue use a metadata schema to convey information such as author and subject. But it is not a requirement of enjoying a library, gallery or museum that we consult the card catalogue. We can just look at things, and the curators of the content can arrange it so as to encourage us to do that.


      <h2>Descriptive semantics</h2>
      <p>The cards in the catalogue describe the things. If we have something specific in mind, it's easier to go to what we think is the right cabinet and browse the cards, rather than hunt through books on the shelves. We can quickly find the cards (the descriptions) for books by a particular author.</p>

      <h2>Presentation Semantics</h2>
      <p>The organisational scheme provided by metadata is used in the library to present the real objects to us as well. They have been shelved by subject, and then by author perhaps. A decision has been made about collecting things together to make it easy for us to find them in a physical space. There is usually some relationship between the  
       metadata schema and the arrangement of the items on view.</p>

      <h2>The Human Presentation API</h2>
      <p>The arrangement of books on shelves, and the design and conventions of book covers, are part of our human API for interacting with the world.</p>

      <p>When we find a particular book in a library or look at a painting in a gallery, we don’t need to consult a metadata standard to understand what the text and images on the book cover or on a gallery label mean. It’s part of our shared cultural understanding of the world. We know the publisher, title and author of this book by looking at the “metadata” on the cover; we can pick it up and read it. If we're looking at a painting or a sculpture, the descriptive metadata might help us understand it and give it context, but we never confuse the description with the object itself.</p>

      <p>We know how the strings of text presented to us on the gallery label relate to what we can see in front of us. We don't need a guide or a key.</p>

      <h2>Descriptive semantics give us pathways</h2>
      <p>Just as the descriptive semantics on the cards influence the presentation of the material in a physical space, we can use the metadata to drive navigation. On the web, we have the ability to shelve a book in many different places at once, so descriptive metadata gives us powerful tools for exploration. Descriptive semantics inform the collection of books on shelves, the ink-on-paper of a book cover, the labelling of an exhibit or the information architecture of a web site.</p>

      <p>These are perhaps statements of the obvious. I don’t have to consult the card index to browse, read or view a physical book or painting, or write an essay about it. The Human Presentation API is my cultural awareness of what book covers and gallery labels mean, and my ability to navigate a book. Which way up to hold it, whether to start at the back or the front, how to turn the pages.</p>

      <h2>Digital surrogate</h2>
      <p>I still have my cultural awareness when looking at a digital surrogate. But the computer needs assistance in presenting that digital surrogate to me. It needs to be mediated by metadata that can drive a viewing experience so my human cultural awareness can take over again. If I'm doing my viewing over the web, the machines and software involved need some help.</p>

      <p>People have been putting digital surrogates online since the start of the web.
