        <h2>Presentation semantics</h2>
        <p>The descriptive scheme provided by metadata is also used in the library to present the real objects to us. Books
            might be shelved by subject, and then by author. A decision has been made about collecting things together to
            make it easy for us to find them in a physical space. Conventionally, that decision is driven by a metadata scheme.
            There is usually some relationship between the arrangement of items on view (and in storage), and the model that
            the metadata scheme uses to describe the world.</p>


        <p>In an exhibtion space, that arrangement may be partly or entirely unconnected to a formal metadata scheme, but there
            has still been a decision made about how objects relate to each other and how they are aggregated in collections
            for people to look at or interact with.</p>

        <p>The metadata scheme helped decide how objects are collected together and made available to humans, but at that point,
            something else takes over.</p>
