            <h2>The Human Presentation API</h2>

            <p>The arrangement of books on shelves, and the design and conventions of book covers, are part of our human API for interacting with the world.</p>

            <p>When we find a particular book in a library or look at a painting in a gallery, we don’t need to consult a metadata standard to understand what the text and images on the book cover or on a gallery label mean. It’s part of our shared cultural understanding of the world. We know the publisher, title and author of this book by looking at the “metadata” on the cover; we can pick it up and read it. If we're looking at a painting or a sculpture, the descriptive metadata might help us understand it better, but we never confuse the description with the object itself.</p>

            <p>We know how the strings of text presented to us on the gallery label relate to what we can see in front of us. We don't need a guide or a key to interpret the label.</p>

            <p>Just as the descriptive semantics on the cards influence the presentation of the
                material in a physical space, we can use the metadata to drive navigation. On the
                web, we have the ability to shelve a book in many different places at once, so
                descriptive metadata gives us powerful tools for exploration. Descriptive semantics
                inform the collection of books on shelves, the ink-on-paper of a book cover, the
                labelling of an exhibit or the information architecture of a web site.</p>

            <p>These are all perhaps statements of the obvious. I don’t have to consult catalogue
                metadata to browse, read or view a physical book or painting, or write an essay
                about it. The Human Presentation API is my cultural awareness of what book covers
                and gallery labels mean. Which way up to hold a book, whether to start at the back
                or the front, how to turn the pages, how to interpret a table of contents and
                navigate to a chapter, how to use an index.</p>
