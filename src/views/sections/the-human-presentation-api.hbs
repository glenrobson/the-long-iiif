<h2>The Human Presentation API</h2>
<p>The arrangement of books on shelves, and the design and conventions of book covers, are part of our human API for interacting with the world.</p>

<p>When we find a particular book in a library or look at a painting in a gallery, we don’t need to consult a metadata standard to understand what the text and images on the book cover or on a gallery label mean. It’s part of our shared cultural understanding of the world. We know the publisher, title and author of this book by looking at the “metadata” on the cover; we can pick it up and read it. If we're looking at a painting or a sculpture, the descriptive metadata might help us understand it better, but we never confuse the description with the object itself.</p>

<p>We know how the strings of text presented to us on the gallery label relate to what we can see in front of us. We don't need a guide or a key to interpret the label.</p>
